        Highly motivated, performance driven Full Stack Developer with an
        accomplished, diverse background in web development, healthcare,
        management, and financial securities. Emotional intelligent decision
        maker with proven experience in collaboration/communication, leadership,
        adaptability, and conflict resolution. Enthusiastic to work with new
        technologies and architectures in a forward-thinking organization thatâ€™s
        always pushing boundaries. Ability to possess complete, end-to-end
        ownership of projects while effectively demonstrating communication and
        collaboration in a team-driven environment. Experience building products
        across the stack with a firm understanding of web frameworks, APIs,
        databases, and multiple back-end languages, protocols and standards.
        Strong problem solving and analytical skills align with my proficiency
        in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Express.js, React.js, Node.js,
        progressive web apps, agile development methodologies, computer science,
        database theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, version control systems, and their
        respective best practices. My vast experience in multiple arenas has
        been fueled by the persistent call and inertia thereafter to constantly
        challenge myself. In a world where unconventional is the status quo, I
        hope that my diverse background piques your interest as equally as I am
        excited to take on the next challenge.
